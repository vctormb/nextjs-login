# NextJS using NextAuth

A small project using NextAuth as an example to authenticate users using a Provider (eg: GitHub) or
providing a username / password. Everything is mocked for testing purposes.

If you want to test it in your machine, copy and paste the `.env.local.example` and rename it to `.env.local`. 
Provide the necessary keys to make the authentication work.
